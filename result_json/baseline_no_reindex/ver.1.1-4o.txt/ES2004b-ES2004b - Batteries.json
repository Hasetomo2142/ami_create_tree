Your task is to identify the one past dialogue turn that directly influenced the current turn. Use the content, context, and sequence of the dialogue to make your determination.\n\nCurrent Turn (Index: 23):\n- AE_ID: ES2004b.B.argumentstructs.Erik.24\n- Speaker: B\n- Sentence: \"Yes, which it is cheaper in the long run as well\"\n\nPast Dialogue Turns:\nAE_ID ES2004b.B.argumentstructs.Erik.20 (Index: 16, Speaker: B): \"Yes.\"\nAE_ID ES2004b.B.argumentstructs.Erik.21 (Index: 17, Speaker: B): \"Rechargeable with a docking station.\"\nAE_ID ES2004b.C.argumentstructs.Erik.25 (Index: 20, Speaker: C): \"Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine, and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time.\"\nAE_ID ES2004b.B.argumentstructs.Erik.22 (Index: 21, Speaker: B): \"field.\"\nAE_ID ES2004b.B.argumentstructs.Erik.23 (Index: 22, Speaker: B): \"Okay.\"\n\nGuidelines:\n- Only consider the provided past dialogue turns as potential influencing turns.\n- The influencing turn is typically the one the current turn is responding to or building upon.\n- Pay attention to references, questions, answers, and topic continuity.\n- Do not assume any information beyond what is provided.\n\nAnswer Format:\n- Provide only the AE_ID (alphabets and numbers) of the influencing past turn.\n- Do not include any explanations, justifications, or additional information.\n\nAnswer:\n",
