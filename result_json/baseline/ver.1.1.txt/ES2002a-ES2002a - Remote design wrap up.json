Your task is to identify the one past dialogue turn that directly influenced the current turn. Use the content, context, and sequence of the dialogue to make your determination.\n\nCurrent Turn (Index: 16):\n- AE_ID: ES2002a.D.argumentstructs.Erik.11\n- Speaker: D\n- Sentence: \"Okay.\"\n\nPast Dialogue Turns:\nAE_ID ES2002a.A.argumentstructs.Erik.3 (Index: 8, Speaker: A): \"Because there's a cap there, so um depends on how much you can cram into that price.\"\nAE_ID ES2002a.B.argumentstructs.Erik.5 (Index: 9, Speaker: B): \"Yeah.\"\nAE_ID ES2002a.D.argumentstructs.Erik.10 (Index: 10, Speaker: D): \"Okay.\"\nAE_ID ES2002a.A.argumentstructs.Erik.4 (Index: 14, Speaker: A): \"I think that that's the main factor.\"\nAE_ID ES2002a.B.argumentstructs.Erik.7 (Index: 15, Speaker: B): \"Okay. Right, okay, we'll that's that's the end of the meeting, then.\"\n\nGuidelines:\n- Only consider the provided past dialogue turns as potential influencing turns.\n- The influencing turn is typically the one the current turn is responding to or building upon.\n- Pay attention to references, questions, answers, and topic continuity.\n- Do not assume any information beyond what is provided.\n\nAnswer Format:\n- Provide only the AE_ID (alphabets and numbers) of the influencing past turn.\n- Do not include any explanations, justifications, or additional information.\n\nAnswer:\n",
