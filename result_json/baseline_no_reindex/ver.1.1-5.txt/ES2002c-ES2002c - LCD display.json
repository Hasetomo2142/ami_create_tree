Your task is to identify the one past dialogue turn that directly influenced the current turn. Use the content, context, and sequence of the dialogue to make your determination.\n\nCurrent Turn (Index: 18):\n- AE_ID: ES2002c.A.argumentstructs.Erik.13\n- Speaker: A\n- Sentence: \"Um I I'm not saying there's no need for an L_C_D_ display, but um it's  what's what what would it tell the user, 'cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? We have the option of the speaker as well  the sa the same thing goes for the speaker, is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ?\"\n\nPast Dialogue Turns:\nAE_ID ES2002c.B.argumentstructs.Erik.20 (Index: 10, Speaker: B): \"Yeah.\"\nAE_ID ES2002c.A.argumentstructs.Erik.12 (Index: 12, Speaker: A): \"I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it, so um it's a bit nuts to get the  Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know.\"\nAE_ID ES2002c.D.argumentstructs.Erik.19 (Index: 13, Speaker: D): \"Right, okay\"\nAE_ID ES2002c.B.argumentstructs.Erik.21 (Index: 14, Speaker: B): \"Mm oh yeah that's true.\"\nAE_ID ES2002c.B.argumentstructs.Erik.22 (Index: 17, Speaker: B): \"So so no need for an L_C_D_ display ?\"\n\nGuidelines:\n- Only consider the provided past dialogue turns as potential influencing turns.\n- The influencing turn is typically the one the current turn is responding to or building upon.\n- Pay attention to references, questions, answers, and topic continuity.\n- Do not assume any information beyond what is provided.\n\nAnswer Format:\n- Provide only the AE_ID (alphabets and numbers) of the influencing past turn.\n- Do not include any explanations, justifications, or additional information.\n\nAnswer:\n",
