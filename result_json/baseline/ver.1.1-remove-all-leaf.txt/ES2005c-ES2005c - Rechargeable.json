Your task is to identify the one past dialogue turn that directly influenced the current turn. Use the content, context, and sequence of the dialogue to make your determination.\n\nCurrent Turn (Index: 24):\n- AE_ID: ES2005c.C.argumentstructs.Erik.35\n- Speaker: C\n- Sentence: \"I'm I'm with uh Raj on that, I think, you know, I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house, there's not really ever sun coming in my window.\"\n\nPast Dialogue Turns:\nAE_ID ES2005c.C.argumentstructs.Erik.33 (Index: 19, Speaker: C): \"Right um what are the other options ?\"\nAE_ID ES2005c.A.argumentstructs.Erik.21 (Index: 20, Speaker: A): \"Uh there's solar power. Um.\"\nAE_ID ES2005c.B.argumentstructs.Erik.10 (Index: 21, Speaker: B): \"Uh, solar power will w also not be a good idea, because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy, and the days when there is no sola sunlight   Yeah. Yeah.\"\n\nGuidelines:\n- Only consider the provided past dialogue turns as potential influencing turns.\n- The influencing turn is typically the one the current turn is responding to or building upon.\n- Pay attention to references, questions, answers, and topic continuity.\n- Do not assume any information beyond what is provided.\n\nAnswer Format:\n- Provide only the AE_ID (alphabets and numbers) of the influencing past turn.\n- Do not include any explanations, justifications, or additional information.\n\nAnswer:\n",
