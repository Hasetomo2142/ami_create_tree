Your task is to identify the one past dialogue turn that directly influenced the current turn. Use the content, context, and sequence of the dialogue to make your determination.\n\nCurrent Turn (Index: 16):\n- AE_ID: ES2004b.C.argumentstructs.Erik.10\n- Speaker: C\n- Sentence: \"Yeah. Yeah.\"\n\nPast Dialogue Turns:\nAE_ID ES2004b.D.argumentstructs.Erik.7 (Index: 9, Speaker: D): \"Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def\"\nAE_ID ES2004b.B.argumentstructs.Erik.9 (Index: 10, Speaker: B): \"Um, but quite, um, easily labelled so that anyone can  oh yeah that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations, um\"\nAE_ID ES2004b.C.argumentstructs.Erik.9 (Index: 14, Speaker: C): \"they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh  so if you  I don't know what  'cause you  obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others.\"\nAE_ID ES2004b.A.argumentstructs.Erik.5 (Index: 15, Speaker: A): \"Yeah, uh maybe to  as uh  it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use, the injuries, maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that.\"\n\nGuidelines:\n- Only consider the provided past dialogue turns as potential influencing turns.\n- The influencing turn is typically the one the current turn is responding to or building upon.\n- Pay attention to references, questions, answers, and topic continuity.\n- Do not assume any information beyond what is provided.\n\nAnswer Format:\n- Provide only the AE_ID (alphabets and numbers) of the influencing past turn.\n- Do not include any explanations, justifications, or additional information.\n\nAnswer:\n",
