So I propose the easy to use uh prototype. You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can  the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end  in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some  to do some preprocessing. From the technical aspect, the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the  on the remote controller, right ?
