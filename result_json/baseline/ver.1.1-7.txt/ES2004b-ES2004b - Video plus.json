Use the content, context, and sequence of the dialogue to make your determination.\n\nCurrent Turn (Index: 27):\n- AE_ID: ES2004b.B.argumentstructs.Erik.16\n- Speaker: B\n- Sentence: \"Okay so\"\n\nPast Dialogue Turns:\nAE_ID ES2004b.C.argumentstructs.Erik.17 (Index: 16, Speaker: C): \"It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things.\"\nAE_ID ES2004b.B.argumentstructs.Erik.15 (Index: 17, Speaker: B): \"No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that\"\nAE_ID ES2004b.D.argumentstructs.Erik.12 (Index: 18, Speaker: D): \"Superb.\"\nAE_ID ES2004b.D.argumentstructs.Erik.13 (Index: 21, Speaker: D): \"Yes.\"\nAE_ID ES2004b.C.argumentstructs.Erik.18 (Index: 22, Speaker: C): \"Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it  you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series.\"\nAE_ID ES2004b.C.argumentstructs.Erik.19 (Index: 25, Speaker: C): \"So that  yeah.
