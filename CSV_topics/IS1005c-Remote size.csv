So let's say an average size, okay, and it should not be very heavy also. And I prefer to  is it shouldn't have a uniform shape, so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner, maybe maybe. So we c it's like like some joysticks. You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape.
